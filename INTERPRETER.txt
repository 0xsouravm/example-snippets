Simple Interpreter for a Custom Programming Language in Rust
Design and implement an interpreter for a simple, custom programming language using Rust. The language supports basic arithmetic operations, syntax checking, and user-defined functions. The goal of this project is to demonstrate your understanding of lexical analysis, parsing, abstract syntax trees (AST), and interpretation.

Language Features
    Arithmetic Operations:
        Addition (+)
        Subtraction (-)
        Multiplication (*)
        Division (/)
Functions:
    Define functions with the function keyword.
    Function parameters.
    Call functions with arguments.
Syntax Checking:
    Proper use of parentheses.
    Correct operator usage.
